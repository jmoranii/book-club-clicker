## About

This game was coded entirely with [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/claude-code) — no hand coding — as a way to explore and learn AI-assisted development tools.

Built as an homage and thank you to my book club members: James, Sydney, Tiffany, Winslow, Kyle, Jane, Andrew, Daniel, Conner, Megan, Cora, Andy, Ben, Paul, and Patryk.

Here's to the next 10 years.
